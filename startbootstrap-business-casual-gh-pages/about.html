                <p>I was born and raised in Colorado, as it turns out it did not help me avoid the 
                  attitude that my parents brought with them from Jersey. I grew up between Colorado 
                  and California. Durning school I learned my passion for the adrenaline sports. I 
                  began with quads and dirt bikes, moved in to snowboarding and wake boarding, 
                  followed by tracking my cars and bikes. As I began to adult I realized my pervious 
                  invincibility was beginning to show age. As such I had to pull back from racing and 
                  decided to move my attention to lower impact sports. So, after completing this 
                  program I will be getting my skydiving license as my grad present.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">Ever since I was a kid I have enjoyed taking things apart 
                  to see how they worked. This led me to realize my love for working with 
                  my hands and building stuff, anything from circuit boards to houses. The ability 
                  to build a concept, was one of the leading reasons to join the coding world. Because 
                  I like many different industries I thought perfecting the ability to shift between 
                  them would be an ideal place to start.</p>
